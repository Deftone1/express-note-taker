My job this week was to create an Express note taker using the newly learned Express Routing that uses a db.json file to store, retrieve, and delete the notes as needed. 

This is the third assignment using back end technologies and the first assignment with the requirement of deploying to Heroku.

One of the first steps I made was creating the VS Code file with the provided starter code and almost immediately deployed to Heroku (as was encouraged) to ensure there were no problems deploying to the site. 

The HTML route page and server.js were then set up and console logged repeatedly until I was able to move to the api route page.

The api routing was a bit tricky, especially with the POST api. I was having the issue at first of concatenating the id numbers together with each new note post. It took a lot of trial and error to make it work.

This was a fun assignment overall, and an exciting one as well. I'm looking forward to learning/using Heroku more in the future through my continued experience with server-side programming.
